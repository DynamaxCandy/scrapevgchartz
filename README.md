# scrapevgchartz
 It's a simple code to scrape game data from <https://www.vgchartz.com/> , inclunding console, publisher, total shipped, etc.There are many other codes about scraping data from vgchartz, but the structure of this web has changed, most of them can't work out. So I write this new file. 
 As a green hand in programming, this is my first scrape code. There must be something I haven't noticed. So you are welcome to point it out. It will be important for me to improve my skills.

# Acknowledgements
 I learned a lot from the pioneers who did this job before like @GregorUT and his project <https://github.com/GregorUT/vgchartzScrape> , etc. Thank you so much.
